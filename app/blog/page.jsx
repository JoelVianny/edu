During their bachelor's degree, students gain a broad understanding of their chosen specialty, with the opportunity to explore various areas of interest. Graduates with a bachelor's degree can immediately begin working in their chosen profession, or they can continue their studies at the next level. Additionally, some universities still offer specialist programs, a level that only exists in Russia. Specialist programs provide a more focused education over 5â€“6 years that emphasizes practical skills.",
